Systems that incorporate both modulation of cellular function and recording capabilities can enhance the utility of these approaches and their customization to the needs of each patient. Here we report an integrated optogenetic and bioelectronic platform for stable and long-term stimulation and monitoring of cardiomyocyte function in vitro.
