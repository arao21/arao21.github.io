Sleep involves continuous communication between the brain and body, yet the dynamics of peripheral signals during human sleep remain poorly understood. Here we tested whether gastric electrophysiology exhibits infraslow structure and coordinated fluctuations with cortical rhythms indicative of sleep physiology.
