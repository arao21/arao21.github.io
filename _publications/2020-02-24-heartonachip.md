**Heart-on-a-chip Model with Integrated Extra- and Intra-cellular Bioelectronics for Monitoring Cardiac Electrophysiology under Acute Hypoxia.**  
*Nano Letters*, 2020.

We developed a bioelectronic heart-on-a-chip platform to study the effects of acute hypoxia on cardiac electrophysiology. A microfluidic channel enabled rapid modulation of oxygenation, mimicking transient coronary occlusion and reversibly activating hypoxia-related signaling pathways in HL-1 cardiomyocytes.
