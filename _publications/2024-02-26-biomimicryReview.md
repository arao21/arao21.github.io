Effective strategies in cardiac tissue engineering require matrices that recapitulate the mechanical, topographic and electrical cues present in the native extracellular matrix. In this review, we discuss recent efforts in materials science and nanotechnology to achieve functional 3D scaffolds that modulate and monitor cardiac tissue function.
