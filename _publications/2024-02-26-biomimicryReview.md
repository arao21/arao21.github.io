**From Biomimicry to Bioelectronics: Smart Materials for Cardiac Tissue Engineering.**  
*Nano Research*, 2020.

Effective strategies in cardiac tissue engineering require materials that recapitulate the mechanical, topographic, and electrical cues of the native extracellular matrix. This review surveys advances in smart materials and nanotechnology for creating functional 3D scaffolds that both modulate and monitor cardiac tissue behavior.
