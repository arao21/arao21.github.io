I am a fourth-year PhD student in Bioengineering at Stanford University, advised by Prof. Todd Coleman. My research combines multimodal electrophysiology and wearable sensing to better understand brain-body interactions.

Broadly, I’m interested in how peripheral physiology and neural rhythms are coordinated during sleep and wake states, and how these dynamics can inform next-generation biomarkers from wearable and scalable sensing.

**Research Themes**
- Brain-body coupling during sleep
- Wearable signal processing and physiologic modeling
- Translational machine learning for clinical decision support
